## WebEXE API

So, I am working on my own API called WebEXE. This will, when it's done, allow for users running Windows to run apps from a server for cheap (because it's open source). If you use this shoddy (as of now) API, **please** credit me.

### Limitations

As of Tues. Apr. 10, 2018, the test client will not work with HTTPS. This seems to be due to the fact that I wrote it in Microsoft Smallbasic, which is a little bit dated. So, in the future, I will rewrite the test client in Python, or Java, or maybe even VisualBasic. Sorry.

### Future Features

Soon, you will be able to save your settings on the server. This will be done by using some sort of settings file that says where each real settings file needs to be placed.
